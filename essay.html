                WSOA3028A_Critical Analysis of the Function ofUI/UX Design_2483967
The website is successful in subverting traditional UI/UX design practices by raising awareness about endangered species through an innovative design approach; Through intuitive insight, the website brings into play impressions, ideas, and thoughts that we have unknowingly collected on a subconscious, unconscious, or on a pre-conscious level and that indicates the design of the website is grounded in user engagement with a topic that to some extent will affect peoples’ everyday practices. 
The communication perspective is where the designer and user communicate through hypermedia within a social and cultural context (E. Toppano and V. Roberto, 2009). The website in contrast to popular design practices focused on engagement with people and practices i.e the communication perspective. This can be interpreted as strengthening the argument that this website effectively encourages the concept of digital design for socially significant topics that are otherwise overlooked and ignored because they are deemed to be unimportant to the current generation of human occupants. Further instances where the UI/UX reflects untraditional web design practices is seen where the website effectively uses the "Function Complex" and "Telesis" concept where the content of the website reflects the times and conditions that have given rise to it and thus fit in with the general human socioeconomic order in which it is to operate the website highlights the significant global extinction events of endangered animal species through aesthetically pleasing and/or engaging UI and UX design (Papek, 1984). 
This website design challenges the Western-centric design "clickbait" norms which are prevalent in many websites, focused on monetization, whereas the UI/UX design of “Species in Pieces”, 2015 offers a more socially inclusive and culturally sensitive experience. Successfully working to subvert traditional UI/UX principles, and breaking free from the incentive/capitalist-based constraints of established design paradigms and principles. By taking an otherwise unengaging area of concern and using abstract shapes and fragmented images, to challenge conventional UI/UX design principles thus making a dull topic a UI/UX masterclass and an artistic/symbolic display thus captivating users by evoking emotions and eliciting a deeper meaning of the subject matter (Kaplan et al, 1998). 
As a result of not restricting users to a set of clear instructions and simplified navigation to ensure users can easily accomplish their tasks, the interactive elements of the website challenge traditional approaches by breaking away from predefined actions and allowing users to freely explore and experiment with the fragmented shapes (E. Purinton and D.E. Rosen, 2004). Ultimately, differing from conventional design goals of optimization, efficiency, simplicity, and ease of user engagement. The website further achieves this by revealing more as the user engages with the website where control is in the user's hands rotating and manipulating the fragmented shapes to reassemble the animal image, providing a sense of participation and engagement (E. Toppano and V.Roberto, 2009).
The website challenges both the traditional visual and interactive elements along with the overall user experience by placing equal importance on user engagement as well as user education by engaging with the user and then teaching them at the sametime thus differing from both commercial websites, which emphasize captivating UI, and educational websites, which aim to present useful information to users, by creating a hybrid of both where users learn without really meaning to almost like experimenting with the fragmented shapes like a child, delivering a sense of discovery and playfulness much like a game the user learns more by purely engaging and not necessarily inputting information into search bars etc. like a traditional website (E. Purinton and D.E. Rosen, 2004). 
With regard to the environmental significance of the website and the effect that has had on the UI and UX design. The fragmentation, rotation, and origami style representation of the animals facilitate an interactive user experience through the concept of a digital environment (digital zoo) thus effectively using both UI and UX to entrench users into the digital environment (E. Purinton andD.E. Rosen, 2004). The website is effective in converting web surfers to repeat visitors through effective web design because people appreciate and are motivated to learn information without having to first sift through it, which helps us expand on previous knowledge contained within our cognitive maps (E.Purinton and D.E. Rosen, 2004). This is evident because people have a basic understanding of animal endangerment and the aspects of human living that facilitates species endangerment, and this website makes learning about raising awareness of endangered species fun without oversimplifying user engagement i.e the complexity of the website design contains varying abstract images thus satisfy the desire to explore the environment (E. Purinton and D.E. Rosen,2004). 
This website is defined by the use of many, varied visual images thatfit the site content tying the complexity of the site to its content enhancing comprehensibility, and encouraging rather than discouraging exploration which means the UI and UX have been specifically designed to target this natural characteristic of human beings as we yearn to know what goes on around us (Kaplanet al, 1998). 
Ultimately, the website presents a unique and thought-provoking approach to UI/UX designprocess. The function of this website is different from that of a typical website, which in turn impacts the UI and UX design presented to the user. The website’s visual design comprises of abstract shapes, fragmented images, and free-flowing design principles challenging traditional and rigid UI design concepts. Instead of prioritizing clarity and simplicity, it engages users and subverts the principle of a clear visual hierarchy by intentionally creating a fragmented artistic and symbolic experience fostering an environment of discovery and playfulness by departing from the traditional it evokes emotions and provokes thought, aiming to elicit a deeper engagement and understanding of species endangerment ultimately inventing a new niche the conventional goal of optimizing efficiency and ease of use are thrown out the window and a digital landscape where complexity increases foot traffic. References: 1.
